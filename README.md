# Project Name

Analyze

## Summary

This project aims to analyze data provided in an Excel file (data.xlsx) using a Python script (execute.py) and generate results in a JSON format. The data file will be converted to a CSV format (data.csv) for easier processing. A GitHub Actions workflow will be set up to automate the analysis process by running the Python script and publishing the results on GitHub Pages.

## Setup

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and Pandas 2.3 installed.
3. Commit execute.py after fixing the non-trivial error in it.
4. Convert data.xlsx to data.csv and commit it.
5. Add a GitHub Actions push workflow at .github/workflows/ci.yml as described in the brief.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the setup is completed.
2. Run the GitHub Actions workflow by pushing changes to the repository.
3. View the analysis results in the generated result.json on GitHub Pages.

## Code Explanation

- `execute.py`:
  - This Python script will read the data from data.csv, perform the required analysis, and save the results in a JSON file named result.json.
  - Ensure that the typo "revenew" is fixed to "revenue" before committing the file.

- Data Conversion:
  - The provided data.xlsx file should be converted to data.csv before committing it to the repository for better compatibility with Pandas.

- GitHub Actions Workflow:
  - The CI workflow at .github/workflows/ci.yml will run ruff to check for code quality, execute the Python script, and publish the results on GitHub Pages.
